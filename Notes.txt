Git separates commit author and push authentication.
What matters for pushing is which account authenticates with GitHub. ie joshcode30
Edit user.name and user.email to change author for the push.
Previous commits were dont by josh-f3 hence they were the author.
After change, the author for this file was joshcode30.
